Perform the clustering analysis of the data on CMPSC-131 students' performance. You script shall:

Normalize each column by dividing it by the maximum number
Calculate the mean of all "Q" and "A" columns (call the new column "Assignments")
Partition the rows into seven clusters, based only on the values of "Final" and "Assignments"
Scatter plot the original scores in the "Final" and "Assignments" coordinates
In the same chart, scatter plot the cluster centroids using a different marker style
The chart must have X and Y axes labels. Save it as a PNG file. A sample output (for 4 clusters) is attached.
